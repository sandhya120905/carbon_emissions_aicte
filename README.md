# Carbon Emission Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains my project for the AICTE Edunet SkillsFuture Internship. The focus is on building a machine learning pipeline to predict carbon emissions using real-world climate data. The work begins with thorough data preparation and continues into model building and evaluation using Python and machine learning libraries.

## Project Structure

- data/climate_change_download_0.csv â€“ Raw dataset
- data/data_cleaned.csv â€“ Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
- 1_data_preparation.ipynb â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- 2_data_exploaration.ipynb -exploring data and visualisation
## Objectives

- Understand and clean the dataset for effective analysis
- Handle missing values and irrelevant features
- Prepare the data for machine learning models
- Maintain clarity in the code through meaningful comments and structure

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Improvements Made

While following the base project provided by the mentor, I made several enhancements to improve clarity and structure:
- Added informative print statements to track progress
- Used consistent and readable variable names
- Organized the notebook with section headers and helpful comments
- Exported cleaned data for further use

## Internship Context

This project was completed under the AICTE Edunet SkillsFuture Internship program. The core notebook was provided by the mentor, and I focused on enhancing the existing structure and maintaining clean, understandable code throughout.

## What I Learned

- Practical steps in preparing real-world data for ML applications
- Importance of well-documented, readable code
- How to work within a structured project while adding personal improvements
